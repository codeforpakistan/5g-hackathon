            All Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums
            and their staff, presenters, and participants are held to an
            anti-harassment policy, detailed below. In addition to governing our
            own events by this policy, Code for Pakistan will only lend our
            brand and fund groups that offer an anti-harassment policy to their
            attendees.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Code for Pakistan is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
            experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and
            expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
            body size, race, age, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
            staff, presenters, and participants in any form. Sexual language and
            imagery is not appropriate for any Code for Pakistan event or
            network activity, including talks.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Anyone in violation of these policies may be expelled from Code for
            Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums, at the
            discretion of the event organizer or forum administrator. Harassment
            includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or written comments
            related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
            orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
            religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
            stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
            disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
            unwelcome sexual attention; unwarranted exclusion; and patronizing
            language or action. If a participant engages in harassing behavior,
            the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
            warning the offender or expulsion from Code for Pakistan network
            activities, events, and digital forums.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the
            event staff or forum administrator immediately. You can contact
            them. Event staff or forum administrators will be happy to help
            participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement,
            provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment
            to feel safe for the duration of the event. If you cannot reach an
            event organizer or forum administrator and/or it is an emergency,
            please remove yourself from the situation. You can also contact Code
            for Pakistan about harassment on <a href="mailto:info@codeforpakistan.org">info@codeforpakistan.org</a>. Code for
            Pakistan staff acknowledge that we are not always in a position to
            evaluate a given situation due to the number of events and the fact
            that our team is not always present.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            However, we are hopeful that by providing these guidelines we are
            establishing a community that jointly adheres to these values and
            can provide an environment that is welcoming to all. We value your
            attendance and hope that by communicating these expectations widely
            we can all enjoy a harassment free environment.
