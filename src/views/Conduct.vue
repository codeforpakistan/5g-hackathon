          <p class="mb-4">The Code for Pakistan community expects that Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums:</p>
          <ul class="px-4">
            <li class="mb-4">Are a safe and respectful environment for all participants.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Are a place where people are free to fully express their identities.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Presume the value of others. Everyone's ideas, skills, and contributions have value.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Don't assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Find a way for people to be productive with their skills (technical and not) and energy. Use language such as "yes/and", not "no/but".</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use. Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members, the local government staff and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive.</li>
            <li class="mb-4">Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Code for Pakistan reserves the right to ask anyone in violation of these policies not to participate in Code for Pakistan network activities, events, and digital forums.</p>
